# Template

This repository contains two components.
1. A PHP implementation of a REST API server that supports things like JWTs, Swagger, database access (SQLite by default) and all the ednpoints needed to implement a multi-user multi-blog configuration.
2. A TMS WEB Core implementation of a client. This is essentially a Delphi client that is used to generate the blog website including all the UI for logging in, searching, account management, and so on.

As with any modern web application, other JavaScript libraries/dependencies have been used in this project. Most of the time, this is handled via a CDN link (usually JSDelivr) in the Project.html file. In some cases, for performance or other reasons, they may be included directly.
